    <h3>What are regular expressions?</h3>
    <p>Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that are used to search for substrings
        ("matches") in strings. They are mainly for use in pattern matching.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="material-box">
    <h3>Why would I use them?</h3>

    <p>Regular Expressions have lots of uses in scripting.
        You could use them to replace all occurrences of certain strings in a
        file or test whether a particular input was submitted correctly (Such as an email address).

        What does a regular expression look like?

        A regular expression is usually a set of symbols and characters between two forward slashes. For example,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>/[abc]+/</strong><br/>
        A simple one matching any string that begins with 'a', 'b', or 'c'
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>/^[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]+[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_]$/</strong><br/>
        A regular expression for matching an email address (a little more complex)</p>
