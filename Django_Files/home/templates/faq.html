    <h3>What are regular expressions?</h3>
    <p>Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that are used to search for substrings
        ("matches") in strings. They are mainly for use in pattern matching.</p>

    <h3>Why would I use them?</h3>

    <p>Regular Expressions have lots of uses in scripting.
        You could use them to replace all occurrences of certain strings in a
        file or test whether a particular input was submitted correctly (Such as an email address).

        What does a regular expression look like?

        A regular expression is usually a set of symbols and characters between two forward slashes. For example,
        “/[abc]+/” is a simple one and
        “^[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]+[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_]$ “
        (a regular expression for matching an email address) is a little more complex.</p>
